My name is Sam. 

+ I am from Minnesota
+ One of my favorite colors is purple. 


So we should obviously take a look at plot of MN filled with purple. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
map.state <- map_data("state") 
map.mn <- subset(map.state, region %in% "minnesota")

ggplot(map.mn) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = region, group = group), color = "white") + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) +
  ggtitle("The Wonderful State of Minnesota") + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
```
